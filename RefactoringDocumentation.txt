Bad Smell 1:
Name:       Long Method
Location:   TIGr-TigrParser.py-TigrParser-parse-line 28-78
Reasons:    
            1. Method is too long by several standards - 50 lines, and doesn't fit on a single screen
            2. It is not very easy to understand everything the method is doing and why without a fair amount of reading
            3. There are other bad smells to TigrParser that will be harder to refactor because this method is so long, or are possibly only a problem because nearly everything the class does is handled by the one method.
            
Strategies: Extract Method, Decompose Conditional,
            Method Object (It's half there already, a couple more steps to add from this could be useful before applying Extract Method)
